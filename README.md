# react-element

My first React repository showing a React element

So whats a React element? React element is the smallest building block of a React app

A React Element is what gets returned from components. It's an object that virtually describes the DOM node that a component represents.An element is a plain object describing a component instance or DOM node and its desired properties.

 It is an immutable description object and you can not apply any methods on it.Once an element is created, it is never mutated
 
 A React Element is created by calling  React.createElement() and describe its arguments.
 
 Then one uses ReactDOM.render() to render an element to a page as seen on the repo.
